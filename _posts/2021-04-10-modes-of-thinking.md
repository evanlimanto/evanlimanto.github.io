The human experience is not a well-defined math problem whose solution space is known a priori. There is in essence, an infinite number of ways to perform the same task, limited by imagination. For example, one can conjure hundreds of ways to ask a particular question, and some are much better than others under a fixed metric.

By applying this observation to the act of thinking, I've found myself being able to situationally adapt my thought processes to yield an optimal outcome faster. I will refer to these conditions of the brain as "modes of thinking". Like a car's manual transmission that the driver uses to select a particular gear ratio, the right mode of thinking that I select controls the subsequent thought processes that my brain undergoes.

In general, one needs to have lived through multiple iterations of an experience and its variations before noticing patterns and their emergent behavior. Fortunately, recent work has exposed me to a sufficiently diverse set of problems which demand unique modes of thinking to tackle effectively. This was how I came to realize the existence of this "modes of thinking" paradigm.

Googling "types of thinking" led me to find [formal definitions](https://thepeakperformancecenter.com/educational-learning/thinking/types-of-thinking-2/) for what I will attempt to expound on in this piece; certainly, nothing is new under the sun. That said, it seems like a fun exercise to empirically categorize my cognitive patterns.

I will attempt to keep this list comprehensive as I stumble upon more modes of thinking. Hope it serves useful to the reader in your thinking journey!

## Enumerative
Enumerative thinking is the pattern I used in writing this piece. Often used to answer a well-defined question whose answers can mostly be inferred from experience or observations. Examples of questions to which this can be applied range from "What services depend on this database?" to something as simple as "What have you done this week?". I timebox the duration to which I attempt to enumerate clear-cut answers to such questions since there are clear diminishing returns.

## Free-Form
I apply free-form thinking to solve difficult, especially abstract, problems. By first clearing my head and focusing strongly on a mental image of the object in question. This mode of thinking bears a strong resemblance to the [famous legend](https://www.williamoburns.com/unleashcreativity/2018/2/7/thomas-edison-had-a-creative-trick-to-toggle-the-state-between-awake-and-asleep) of Thomas Edison oscillating between a state of awakeness and sleep to maximize his creativity. This model plays well to the brain's strength of background processing, especially if I've spent a few hours thinking and exploring a problem space. Very often, elegant solutions will unintentionally pop up in my head. It's magical.

## Associative
Associative thinking is like having a search engine in your brain. Occasionally, when someone mentions an obscure bug or ingenious systems idea and I go, "oh wait isn't that just X", it simplifies the person's life because there's precedent for the problem they're trying to solve. Associative thinking is like being a search engine for prose or abstract concepts, and often requires a certain degree of experience in a problem domain. It doesn't require very much effort, and to some extent, relies a lot on the brain's ability to recall memories. This feels like the default implicit way a lot of us human beings think about the world.

## Vicarious
Another way to view this mode of thinking is to phrase it as the question, "What would person X think about Y?". Given our personal biases and the uniqueness of each individual, vicarious thinking can be extremely powerful in its comprehensiveness and depth. It's mind boggling that just by putting myself in someone else's shoes and attempting to decipher what I think that someone would think can catalyze questions that I would've never thought of from first principles. After applying this repeatedly, I find that X's perspective almost becomes second nature, and I no longer have to explicitly perform this exercise.

## Framework-Based
Framework-based thinking can be modeled as a decision tree that gets incrementally refined over time. It can also be encoded as a series of "if X, then Y" statements. Software engineers would call these "best practices", where a commonly encountered problem can be tackled with a series of widely agreed upon methods. For example, the [Eisenhower "Urgent-Important" Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) is a commonly utilized framework to prioritize tasks. A meta observation is that applying the "Modes of Thinking" model this piece describes to problem solving by: characterizing the problem at hand and identifying the best mode of thinking to apply towards solving it, is invoking framework-based thinking.

## Absorptional
Absorptional thinking happens when listening to a person explain a concept or idea at length. For this, I deliberately attempt to start from a tabula rasa state of mind. As information trickles in, I incrementally build my mental model like a bricklayer constructing a wall by laying down a brick at a time, later attempting to fill in gaps through questioning. The unique characteristic of this thought pattern is that it involves my deliberate silencing of adjacent thoughts, and fully concentrating on what the person is saying. In a sense, the mind acts like a artist being told what to draw on a canvas, without being told *how* to draw the object itself.

## Stream-of-Consciousness
While not fully substantiated by evidence, I believe stream-of-consciousness thinking is what most individuals use to engage in meetings and presentations. Given the synchronous, real-time nature of such interactions, there is not enough time to formulate deep thoughts or conclusions. Therefore, one is forced to select from the first handful of things that come to mind and communicate it. I'm a bit hard-pressed to call this a "form of thinking", but sort of processing is happening in the brain, and what is thinking if not work done by the brain?
