## Philosophy
Whether it’s the tech lead or the engineering manager, at least one person needs to be proactively responsible for the responsibilities outlined in the next section, which I believe are necessary for a team to operate efficiently. This is not to say that engineers should be excluded, but that the leaders of the team be the de facto owners. The larger the team, the greater the importance of upholding these roles.

These responsibilities will need to be reviewed and constantly improved to their fullest extent on a recurring basis. Meta-point: scheduling a recurring Operational Improvements review ensures that this is tended to. Ideally, they should scale beyond the presence of certain individuals on the team, such that the process is ingrained into the “team muscle” and works well in spite of team evolution

One could frame these responsibilities as **“engineer infrastructure”**. In a perfect world, engineers should be focused on doing what they do best, which is often designing systems and implementing technical solutions to problems. Anything repeatable and uncreative should be outlined, abstracted away, and performed with minimal repeated reasoning.

In the end, the outcome for all these processes boil down to the following:
- Deciding what to work on next
- Executing on the decisions well

Fundamentally, through these tools, we seek to minimize confusion, time wasted, and uncertainty on fulfilling the team's raison d'etre.
