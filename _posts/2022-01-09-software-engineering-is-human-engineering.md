title:  Software Engineering is Human Engineering

Let me first preface this by mentioning that humans are not meant to be engineered. The choice of words was made purely for aesthetic reasons.

It’s very easy as a software engineer, engulfed in the daily trenches of systems architecture and implementation details, to forget that we often code as a means to an end. We code to build features, to satisfy OKRs, to solve problems, to make something users want. Fundamentally, our end users are humans.

Software engineers also spend most of our time on human-oriented activities. We plan roadmaps to manage humans. We conjure data structures to model the domains of human knowledge. We architect systems to manage human organizations. We write tests to minimize errors made by humans. We write documentation to broadcast knowledge to other humans.

Let this be a reminder that software engineering — unless practiced as art or in isolation — is fundamentally human engineering. Without understanding humans, one cannot practice good software engineering.
